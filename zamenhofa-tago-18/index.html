            <h3>Feliĉan Zamenhofan Tagon</h3>

            <p>
                Zamenhof Day (also known as Esperanto Book Day) is the birthday of the creator of the constructed
                language Esperanto, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Zamenhof">Ludwik Łazarz Zamenhof</a>.
                It’s widely celebrated as the Day of Esperanto by many Esperantists across the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                I even have a t-shirt for the occasion, and you know I’m serious when I have a t-shirt.
            </p>

            <p>
                <img src="/assets/by-post/fzt/cxemizo.png">
            </p>

            <p>
                Zamenhof created Esperanto in 1887. His goal was to create an auxillary language that could be shared by
                everyone equally. A language where everyone is an equal and everyone, regardless of where they were
                born, can communicate and understand each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                I first started learning Esperanto out of sheer curiosity. Almost for the same reason I may have
                otherwise pondered to myself “Hey, how do you insult someone’s mother in Klingon?” – which by the way,
                is to suggest that she has a smooth forehead (Hab SoSlI’ Quch).
            </p>

            <p>
                Warning: Please don’t say this to any Klingons you know, as it’s very insulting, and they’re pretty good
                with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat%27leth">bat’leth</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To me, Esperanto was much more interesting than other constructed languages. I quickly realised that
                it’s a complete language with a rich vocabulary, a ridiculously simple grammar, and believe it or not,
                lots of fluent speakers across the world (and even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Esperanto_speakers">few native speakers</a>).
            </p>

            <p>
                After dabbling with the language for a long time, and studying it more deliberately in recent years, I
                have to admit that it has been one of the most enjoyable things I’ve done.
            </p>

            <p>
                Esperanto has some unique attributes which makes it a fun hobby to pursue, with some big upsides if you
                decide to take it further.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here’s why I’m a big fan:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    ⚡ It’s easy. Esperanto is by far the simplest language to learn, requiring a fraction of the time it
                    would take to learn a national language.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🧠 It’s consistent. It has a regular grammar, with rules that are consistently followed. This is one
                    of the reasons it’s easier to learn. It’s like a programming language for your mouth.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🕺 There’s a strong and very supportive community. Perhaps due to how few speakers there are
                    (relatively speaking), Esperantists always have time for each other. This is a huge benefit for me,
                    because it means I can be in almost any country in the world, and I’ll be able to find an Esperanto
                    speaker who’ll be more than happy to grab a coffee and hang out.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🌎 International friends. Through Esperanto, you can make new friends from all over the world. The
                    first unexpected benefit of this for me was that it gave me a window to a much wider perspective on
                    things, particularly world events. I can read news in Esperanto from different countries, and get a
                    sense of what is happening / what people are thinking in the non-English parts of the big rock we
                    live on.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🗣 It’s a gateway language. While Esperanto probably isn’t the best choice for a language that will
                    open doors to higher paid jobs, it does train your brain in a regular and consistent way to learn a
                    new language. It trains you to think about different aspects of language, including aspects of your
                    native language that you don’t start thinking about until you begin learning a second. Many people
                    go from Esperanto to a third language and find the experience easier with their new
                    language-learning-primed brains.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🛫 Travel. Lots of Esperantists will host other Esperantists in their home towns, for free, making
                    traveling the world even more appealing (and possible). The
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasporta_Servo">Pasporta Servo</a> has been going since
                    1966, allowing Esperantists to find hosts to stay with, or host traveling Esperantists themselves.
                    In each different country, you’ll be able to communicate via Esperanto, and have a completely
                    different experience than the typical tourist trails.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If all that sounds so sweet that you’ve already cancelled your weekend plans, perhaps your next question
                is “How do I learn it?”
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, since I’m here, allow me to give you a few tips:
            </p>

            <p class="esperanto-text center">
                Saluton.
            </p>

            <p class="english-text center closer">
                Hello.
            </p>

            <p>
                That’ll nicely open up a conversation with any Esperanto speaker, and you’ll hear it quite often.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just like other languages, you’ll probably immediately throw in:
            </p>

            <p class="esperanto-text center">
                Kiel vi fartas?
            </p>

            <p class="english-text center closer">
                How are you?
            </p>

            <p>
                To your amazement, you did not in fact ask the other person if they broke wind.
            </p>

            <p>
                Given that you both speak Esperanto, naturally you’re both feeling pretty awesome about things,
                warranting the response:
            </p>

            <p class="esperanto-text center">
                Bonege dankon, kaj vi?
            </p>

            <p class="english-text center closer">
                Great thanks, and you?
            </p>

            <p>
                Maybe you’re a bit tired:
            </p>

            <p class="esperanto-text center">
                Mi estas iomete laca, sed ne malbona.
            </p>

            <p class="english-text center closer">
                I'm a bit tired, but not bad.
            </p>

            <p>
                You’ve just noticed your Esperanto friend is
                <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KykL6rx.gifv">eating her peas one-by-one</a>,
                and want to wrap up the conversation as quickly as possible:
            </p>

            <p class="esperanto-text center">
                Ĝis poste!
            </p>

            <p class="english-text center closer">
                See you later!
            </p>

            <p>
                Here’s a few cool things to note about this conversation.
            </p>

            <p>
                All letters in Esperanto make consistent sounds, so unlike English (where ‘ough’ has approximately 1
                billion different sounds), you can look at a written word and reliably say it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also notice how we have <strong>-as</strong> on the end of the word fart<strong>as</strong>? That’s how
                you make a verb (a doing-word) refer to the present tense in Esperanto.
            </p>

            <p>
                And guess what? That’s <strong>always</strong> how you get the present tense version of a verb. I mean,
                how easy is that? Want the past tense instead? No problem, just change the <strong>-as</strong> to
                <strong>-is</strong>. The future? <strong>-os</strong> will be your friend. The best bit is that these
                rules never change – all verbs can be produced this way, with no exceptions.
            </p>

            <p>
                You probably don’t believe me, but it’s true – if having the sort of grammar that brings tears of joy to
                the eyes of its learners was a crime, Esperanto would be doing life in maximum security.
            </p>

            <p>
                But there’s more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pop-quiz. How do you get the plural of a word in English?
            </p>

            <p>
                Add an ‘s’ to the end, you say? Well sometimes, but it doesn’t always work. I definitely don’t have two
                foots. And while I’ve been told I only have <strong>half</strong> a brain, I figure it’s the stronger of
                the two <strong>halves</strong> I’ve kept.
            </p>

            <p>
                In Esperanto, just add <strong>-j</strong>. You can add it to any singular noun or adjective. That rule
                never changes either.
            </p>

            <p>
                If I have more than one <strong>kato</strong> (cat), I most certainly have <strong>katoj</strong>
                (cats). If I were to drink more than one <strong>biero</strong> (beer), and honestly, I never do, then
                I’d have consumed <strong>bieroj</strong> (beers), and would probably slur my <strong>vortoj</strong>
                (words).
            </p>

            <p>
                In Esperanto, we don’t waste space in our dictionaries with both ‘good’ and ‘bad’, ‘left and ‘right’,
                ‘up’ and ‘down’. We just have one of them, and then use the prefix <strong>mal</strong> to create the
                logical opposite. Now you have fewer words to learn.
            </p>

            <p>
                I can only imagine you’re finding this post <strong>bona</strong> (good), but if you aren’t (and let’s
                face it… you are), you’d be finding it <strong>malbona</strong> (bad).
            </p>

            <p>
                The prefix <strong>mal</strong> can be used to prefix anything, assuming it still makes sense. One could
                say <strong>malsaluton</strong>, which despite stepping all over the toes of <strong>ĝis</strong> (bye),
                would make sense to an Esperanto speaker. It would no doubt also make them think you’re a bit weird, but
                that’s beside the point – perhaps you are.

                Adverbs, adjectives, participles, and every other grammatical aspect of Esperanto has a similar sense of
                structure and consistency like the examples above, making it much easier to learn.
