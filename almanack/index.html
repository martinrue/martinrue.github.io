            <h3 class="main">Highlights: Almanack of Naval Ravikant</h3>

            <p>
                I've just finished reading the very enjoyable <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/">Almanack of Naval Ravikant</a>. It's one of those rare books that made me want to read it as slowly as possible so I could really take in all the bits that resonated with me.
            </p>

            <p>
                Naval is an incredibly clear thinker and manages to capture very cleanly his thoughts on a bunch of subjects that mean something to me, and that I catch myself thinking about a lot.
            </p>

            <p>
                As Naval often mentions, none of what he says is intended as advice – you've got to figure out what all of this means to you, in your life. These highlights simply meant something to me.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you haven't read it yet, I can't imagine you'll conclude it was a waste of your time.
            </p>

            <p>
            <blockquote>
                Value your time. It is all you have. It's more important than your money. It's more important than your friends. It is more important than anything. Your time is all you have. Do not waste your time.
            </blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>
            <blockquote>
                Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you're accountable on your output, as opposed to your input, that's the dream.

                Reading a book isn't a race – the better the book, the more slowly it should be absorbed.

            <blockquote>

            <p>
            <blockquote>
                Lusting for money is bad for us because it is a bottomless pit. It will always occupy your mind. If you love money, and you make it, there's never enough.

            </p>

            <p>
            <blockquote>
                You can save money, you can live a little below your means, and you can find a certain freedom. That will give you the time and the energy to pursue your own internal peace and happiness.
            </blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>
            <blockquote>
                I value freedom above everything else. All kinds of freedom: freedom to do what I want, freedom from things I don't want to do, freedom from my own emotions or things that may disturb my peace. For me, freedom is my number one value.
            </blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>
            <blockquote>
                You cannot hide anything from yourself. Your own failures are written within your psyche, and they are obvious to you. If you have too many of these moral shortcomings, you will not respect yourself.

            <blockquote>
                It takes time – even once you have all of the pieces in place, there is an indeterminate amount of time you have to put in. If you're counting, you'll run out of patience before success actually arrives.

            <p>
            <blockquote>
                Money buys you freedom in the material world. It's not going to make you happy, it's not going to solve your health problems, it's not going to make your family great, it's not going to make you fit, it's not going to make you calm. But it will solve a lot of external problems.
            </blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>
            <blockquote>
                I would rather understand the basics really well than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts I can't stitch together and can't re-derive from the basics. If you can't re-derive concepts from the basics as you need them, you're lost. You're just memorizing.

                It's actually really important to have empty space. If you don't have a day or two every week in your calendar where you're not always in meetings, and you're not always busy, then you're not going to be able to think. It's only after you're bored you have the great ideas. It's never going to be when you're stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time.

The more closely you can tie someone's compensation to the exact value they're creating, the more you turn them into a principal, and the less you turn them into an agent.

                It's really important to be able to un-condition yourself, to be able to take your habits apart and say, “Okay, this is a habit I probably picked up when I was a toddler trying to get my parent's attention. Now I've reinforced it and reinforced it, and I call it a part of my identity. Does it still serve me? Does it make me happier? Does it make me healthier?
