            <h3>You're Not Ready</h3>

            <p>
                I heard something a few days ago. You know, the kind of thing where you stop and think for a while, and
                then the significance starts to become really clear to you.
            </p>

            <p>
            <blockquote>
                You’re not ready, and you never will be
            </blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>
                Yes!
            </p>

            <p>
                Let’s rewind so I can explain why this resonates with me.
            </p>

            <p>
                It feels like I’ve always been interested in foreign language, but it was a day back in University that
                really prompted my fascination.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was with a friend when he bumped into one of his old army buddies. After a few minutes of speaking
                English, they both switched to German and had another conversation. Until that moment, I didn’t even
                know he could speak another language! I still remember how impressed I was that he could do that – just
                drop into a whole new language and have a conversation as emotional and free as he would have in his
                own.
            </p>

            <p>
                Feeling very inspired, I bought a few books and started to learn a little German myself. After a few
                weeks of on/off learning, it was painfully clear to me that this was a huge goal and I was still years
                away from being ready to speak the language.
            </p>

            <p>
                Feeling like I wasn’t yet ready to speak meant that I avoided all situations where, in fact, I may have
                been able to speak even a little bit.
            </p>

            <p>
                And of course being in those situations is exactly how I would have learned more, had I not already
                convinced myself I needed to wait until I was ready.
            </p>

            <p>
                Waiting until you’re ready before you really start something is just another form of not wanting to be
                out of your comfort zone, and it holds you back.
            </p>

            <p>
                A few years ago, I started thinking seriously about giving up full-time work in order to pursue my own
                thing. It was a scary idea – where would I live? How could I earn enough to still live comfortably? What
                would happen? Would I be happier?
            </p>

            <p>
                I had lots of questions, and my gut feeling was that I was completely unready. I was right – I wasn’t
                ready – but this time I wasn’t going to let it stop me trying.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking back on the last 2 years, I’m so glad I just threw myself into it and didn’t wait for some
                future point where I felt ready. That point would have never come.
            </p>

            <p>
                The key is to embrace the fact you’ll never truly be ready, and let yourself into things which feel new,
                uncomfortable, and different.
            </p>

            <p>
                Starting and making progress is what counts. Don’t let the fact you feel unready stop you from trying –
                it’s the trying itself that matters.
            </p>

            <p>
                You’re not ready, and you never will be.
