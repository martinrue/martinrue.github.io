      <title>My Engineering Axioms</title>
      <description>A few months back I gave a talk in which I shared a list of my personal engineering axioms – things that, over the years, I've come to think of as generally true and useful to have in mind when writing code, building things, and working with others.</description>

      <title>Head Up, Head Down</title>
      <description>There are few things more enjoyable to me than the mental solitude that hand-delivers interesting shower thoughts, or that let’s me sit in a bustling coffee shop contemplating life.</description>

      <title>Progress Is Hard</title>
      <description>Today wasn’t a failure because I’ve not reached those states. It was a success because I’ve followed the process – a process that accrues results over time. I’ll be back tomorrow for my next batch.</description>

      <title>Coding Stories: Me vs. The VNC Guy</title>
      <description>I’ve told a few different coding stories over the years on this blog. I enjoy reminiscing about the silly things I used to do. So, in that vein, here’s one I haven’t told yet.</description>

      <title>How Does Esperanto Sound?</title>
      <description>When people hear Esperanto for the first time, they sometimes think they’re hearing Italian, or maybe Spanish. A good amount of vocabulary in Esperanto is taken from romance roots, so this isn’t totally surprising.</description>

      <title>Seek Out New Experiences</title>
      <description>We ofen hear the advice “get out of your comfort zone”, and in my experience it’s good advice to avoid becoming stationary in whatever it is you’re trying to get better at.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Crypto Currency Mania</title>
      <description>It’s the end of 2017 and right now there’s a huge amount of interest in buying [insert any crypto currency coin here]. Everyone wants to buy everything, and as a result we’re very much in a bull market at the moment.</description>

      <title>The Gym</title>
      <description>Anyone who knows me will know that the gym is a fairly big part of my life. While my goal certainly isn’t to become the next Eddie Hall or Phil Heath, during the last 3 years the gym has been a valuable source of discipline and improvement for me.</description>

      <title>Give Yourself More Playtime</title>
      <description>I remember my first computer fondly. As a kid I was more than addicted to the Commodore 64 – perfectly happy to sit and endure at least 5 minutes of the most colourful, potentially epileptic attack you can imagine, simply to have a few games of Boulder Dash.</description>

      <title>Be With Your Thoughts More Often</title>

      <title>To Be Productive, Be Prepared</title>
      <description>Motivation by itself gives us the willingness to do something, but nothing more. Once we make a start, the game changes and it becomes about knowing how to make progress.</description>

      <title>What Is 'The Zone', Anyway?</title>
      <description>Recently I’ve been thinking more and more about the zone. I’ve been trying to work out what it actually is. Most often it’s described as being in a super productive state for short periods of time, where the best code you’ve ever written just flows from your fingertips.</description>

      <title>Talk About Your Stuff</title>
      <description>Growing up I was a pretty shy kid. I didn’t talk to many people and I loved hacking away at things almost in secret. I would get pretty nervous if anyone asked me what I was doing.</description>

      <title>Agile – 'A' For Adjective</title>
      <description>Are you doing happy? No, seriously, are you doing happy? OK, what about this, are you doing flexible? You probably think I’m talking nonsense, and that’s because I am – I’m using adjectives as nouns.</description>

      <title>ZZüy – A Lesson In Perseverance</title>
      <description>I remember when I was first introduced to programming by way of watching my older step brother type the then–very–confusing words gosub and rem onto a bright blue screen. It was exciting. I had no idea what this cryptic language did but I was definitely hooked.</description>
