      <title>To Be Productive, Be Prepared</title>
      <description>Motivation by itself gives us the willingness to do something, but nothing more. Once we make a start, the game changes and it becomes about knowing how to make progress.</description>

      <title>What Is 'The Zone', Anyway?</title>
      <description>Recently I've been thinking more and more about the zone. I've been trying to work out what it actually is. Most often it's described as being in a super productive state for short periods of time, where the best code you've ever written just flows from your fingertips.</description>

      <title>Talk About Your Stuff</title>

      <title>ZZüy – A Lesson In Perseverance</title>
      <description>I remember when I was first introduced to programming by way of watching my older step brother type the then–very–confusing words gosub and rem onto a bright blue screen. It was exciting. I had no idea what this cryptic language did but I was definitely hooked.</description>
