        <h3>5x5 But For People</h3>

        <p>The gym is a source of good lessons.</p>

        <p>Lessons you can often take out of the gym and apply elsewhere in life. And without the grunting… though that's your call, of course.</p>

        <p>Here's a recent one I've been thinking about: 5x5, but for people.</p>

        <p>Let me start by saying that I don't make a habit of quoting the bible, but I think Ecclesiastes nailed it: "There is nothing new under the sun."</p>
        <p>Here's the nod from Twain: "There is no such thing as a new idea. It is impossible. We simply take a lot of old ideas and put them into a sort of mental kaleidoscope."</p>

        <p>
          What creative people do really well is take inspiration from lots of sources. Being in the weeds with more perspectives from different fields, their own work feels newer, bolder, and more
          interesting.
        </p>

        <p>The key is to keep gathering new inputs, new voices, new ideas from different fields and people, and mix them into something fresh.</p>

        <p>In the book "The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking", natural elements are used as metaphors for how to think better. Regarding ideas, we're told to be like water.</p>

        <p>Water wants to flow and be in constant motion, as do our ideas. Being able to "follow the flow of ideas" means we can see where something is going next.</p>

        <p>I like this metaphor. The smartest people I know, with the right information, are very good at knowing what's coming next. They're able to follow the flow of the ideas.</p>

        <p>I mention these two things – both interesting in their own right – because I've realised they both reinforce each other.</p>

        <p>To be more creative, we need more inputs. To see what's next, we need to be like water and follow the flow of ideas.</p>

        <p>But to acquire new inputs, we need to make space. We need to drop old ones that aren't working for us anymore.</p>

        <p>The podcasts we listen to, the books we read, the friends whose advice we take – when do we stop doing that? How do we decide we don't need it anymore?</p>

        <p>The answer is water. The answer is: once we can continually follow the flow of their ideas, thoughts or advice.</p>

        <p>What the hell (here I am quoting the bible again) does this have to do with the gym, Martin?</p>

        <p><i>Patience. This isn't TikTok.</i></p>

        <p>If you go to the gym to get stronger, you'll most likely use the 5x5 technique.</p>

        <p>
          With 5x5, you do 5 sets of 5 reps with a starting weight. If you achieve the full 25 reps, you're allowed to add more weight. It's a simple and effective way to push yourself at the right
          time.
        </p>

        <p>Now apply this to the people and resources you listen to. Is it time to add more weight? Have you reached 25 reps with them?</p>

        <p>Are you following the flow of their ideas every time? If you're always seeing what's next before you hear it from them, you've hit 25 reps. It's time to add some more weight.</p>

        <p>Are you constantly able to anticipate what someone will say? The opinions you'll receive? The advice a book gives you? If so, it's time to find some new inputs.</p>

        <p>And the best bit is that it works both ways.</p>

        <p>Have people hit 25 reps with your own advice, thoughts, or work? Are you working to make yourself heavier?</p>
