        <h3>I built a community of 1,600... accidentally</h3>

        <p>The full story is even weirder ‚Äì strap in!</p>

        <p>Now, when I say community, I mean social network.</p>

        <p>Yes, I made my own social network. It doesn't get much more narcissistic than that.</p>

        <p>The 1,600th user arrived an hour ago. Not that we number them like prisoners or anything‚Ä¶</p>

        <p>*Rewind sound*</p>

        <p>Play is super important for creativity.</p>

        <p>Ask kids. They know. Us adults forget too easily.</p>

        <p>Every year, without fail, an idea will come to me. It'll seem stupid‚Ä¶ usually for solid reasons.</p>

        <p>But the desire to "just play with it" is always there, whispering my name in a seductive voice.</p>

        <p>I'm good at rejecting these random ideas to stay focused on whatever else I'm working on.</p>

        <p>Well, most of the time.</p>

        <p>üõ∞Ô∏è <a href="https://martinrue.com/station">Station</a> and its community of 1,600, is a good exception.</p>

        <p>Back in the pandemic I happened upon an article about a new network called Gemini. I read that article.</p>

        <p>Gemini is similar to the web, except it's not the web. You can't visit Gemini using your web browser ‚Äì you need a <a href="https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange">different one</a>.</p>

        <p>It's an uber-simple network, similar to the very early web ‚Äì before the web changed its internal mission to be about ruining everyone's day.</p>

        <p>It has domains and sites (capsules), but to put your own stuff onto Gemini, you'd have to run your own server.</p>

        <p>Now, I don't mean to brag, but my Mum plays Counter-Strike and knows how to use PGP and BitTorrent.</p>

        <p>This is not normal behaviour.</p>

        <p>Normal mothers don't usually want to run their own servers. This is true even when they have no children.</p>

        <p>So, I decided to write a social network for Gemini.</p>

        <p>I called it Station.</p>

        <p>If you're noticing a space-based theme, it's because there's a space-based theme.</p>

        <p>Gemini is named after the same-named NASA project from 1964. Now you know why Gemini servers listen in port 1964 instead of 443/80.</p>

        <p>Station would be a centralised hub where people could come, hang out, chat and share their ideas.</p>

        <p>I searched around "Geminispace", and nothing else like it existed. Perfect. It was my time to shine.</p>

        <p>Out came Vim, and 2 weeks of rejecting normal routine. I just coded and slept. And some other stuff, but let's not get graphic.</p>

        <p>It's fun building a social network, especially for a protocol that does not have a web framework, or any particular tools or approaches to building apps‚Ä¶ because it doesn't have apps.</p>

        <p>For the technical among you: the Gemini protocol has only one kind of request (GET), which introduces some unique security challenges, too.</p>

        <p>2 weeks later and Station was launched.</p>

        <p>And I had a shower.</p>

        <p>4 people (all friends) signed up and began using it. Then a few more, and then few more. I didn't know where they were coming from.</p>

        <p>I launched Station expecting I'd run the server for a few weeks before the interest died off. Then I could move onto another crazy idea.</p>

        <p>But here I am, 3 years later, watching it hit 1,600.</p>

        <p>I'm active on Station most days, as are many others. It's absolutely already a sub-culture. I'm even going to meet a few folks from Station IRL in Asia.</p>

        <p>I've no idea why 1,600 signed up. All I know is that it's a space that people enjoy using, and for that I'm very grateful.</p>

        <p>Building is fun, but people using what you've built for 3 years is even funner.</p>

        <p>So, play more!</p>

        <p>Put more stuff into the world. Serendipity is waiting for you.</p>

        <p>Got a silly idea? Make it. See what happens. Don't let others tell you it's pointless, a distraction, it won't work, etc. Who cares.</p>

        <p>Put your insane ideas into the world.</p>

        <p>It's easier now than it ever was, so you have no excuse.</p>

        <p>You never know (nor does anyone else) which ideas will stick. Not to mention the skills and experience you'll gain from shipping something, even if none do.</p>

        <p>If you're a Station user, thanks for keeping our community friendly and welcoming. It's awesome to have our little corner on the Internet that only 1600 people know about.</p>

        <p>For now!</p>
