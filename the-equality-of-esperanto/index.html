            <h3>The Equality of Esperanto</h3>

            <p>
                A few days ago I was hanging out in a coffee shop with my Russian friend. We meet every week to chat
                over coffee.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don’t speak a word of Russian (excluding <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/водка#Russian">водка</a>),
                and we’ve never spoken in English. In fact, I’ve never heard my friend speak English, except for the few words
                he uses when ordering coffee.
            </p>

            <p>
                Esperanto is our language of choice.
            </p>

            <p>
                He usually arrives before me, and is already sipping coffee during our “Saluton! Kiel vi fartas?”
                exchange. However, on this occasion I was the one catching the worm. On hearing his charmingly
                functional request for coffee, I was reminded again that despite knowing each other for a while now,
                we’ve never had a conversation in English.
            </p>

            <p>
                Unsurprisingly the reason we haven’t is that we meet to practise Esperanto. We’re both fluent enough to
                be able to enjoy each other’s company for a few hours without the need of another language.
            </p>

            <p>
                When I stop to think about that, it’s quite remarkable.
            </p>

            <p>
                My friend and I have been learning Esperanto casually for about 2 years. I spend no more than 2 hours
                speaking Esperanto each week, except for 1-2 weeklong events each year. Ballparking the amount of time
                I’ve spent speaking Esperanto, it can’t be more than 2 months.
            </p>

            <p>
                That isn’t a lot of time. It’s unlikely I could have made as much progress in a national language with
                that sort of casual effort.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of course this isn’t surprising for anyone who knows anything about Esperanto. One of the design goals
                of the language was to be consistent and easy to learn, and if you ask me, there’s a very strong case to
                be made for it having hit that goal.
            </p>

            <p>
                But, equality? What do I mean by the “equality” of Esperanto?
            </p>

            <p>
                First, a quick detour. Have you heard of the Footbridge Problem?
            </p>

            <p>
                Imagine you’re standing on a footbridge overlooking a train track. A small oncoming train is about to
                kill five people and the only way to stop it is to push a man off the footbridge in front of the train.
                This will kill him, but save the five people. Do you push him?
            </p>

            <p>
                Logically speaking you would expect most people to answer yes. Saving five people by sacrificing one is
                the best of the options. But humans aren’t computers – we’re emotional and moral, and violating the
                moral belief that killing is bad can override the logical response.
            </p>

            <p>
                And indeed, in a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3997430/">2014 study</a>, only
                18% of people said they would push the man to his death to save the other five.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here’s where it gets interesting. The 18% result was observed when people were faced with the dilemma in
                their native language.
            </p>

            <p>
                When the question was asked to people in a foreign language (Spanish in this case), the number of people
                willing to push the man off the footbridge rose to 44%. The same study has been conducted in other
                language pairs with similar results.
            </p>

            <p>
                The study concludes that thinking in a foreign language can create emotional distance compared to your
                native language(s), carrying with it the interesting implication that language may affect how
                utilitarian or how emotionally you respond.
            </p>

            <p>
                As Nelson Mandela himself said:
            </p>

            <p>
            <blockquote>
                If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in
                his own language, that goes to his heart.
            </blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>
                Our native language(s) are part of us, ingrained so deeply that words carry emotion in addition to
                meaning, and elicit from us emotional as well as rational responses.
            </p>

            <p>
                While I could spend time learning Russian to speak to my friend, I would most definitely not be able to
                feel the language the same way he does as a native speaker. The ability to express myself through the
                language would require more effort, or even be limited depending on how much time I’d devoted, compared
                to his as a fluent native speaker.
            </p>

            <p>
                The same would be true in reverse, of course. While my friend may be able to speak English fluently with
                me, it would be harder for him to bend and shape his language use to deeply express himself.
            </p>

            <p>
                This doesn’t always hold true. There are people who master foreign languages to a deep level of fluency,
                where their identity is shared equally across different languages. Multilingual children are a good
                example. However, when we consider learning a new language, there’s a long road ahead in order to reach
                the stage where you’ll be on an equal footing to that of a native speaker. Often it never happens.
            </p>

            <p>
                The thing I most enjoy about communicating in Esperanto is that this imbalance just doesn’t exist.
            </p>

            <p>
                When speaking Esperanto, there’s never a sense that it’s my language, or the language of somebody else.
                It’s simply a tool I share with the person I’m talking to, who’s made the same effort I have in order to
                communicate on an equal footing. I instantly feel a sense of mutual respect that neither of us has
                burdened the other.
            </p>

            <p>
                The effort coming from both sides makes the situation feel more equal. In addition, due to Esperanto
                being a much easier language to learn than any national language, you can find yourself having a very
                strong command of the language after just months (not years) of focused study.
            </p>

            <p>
                It’s the very fact Esperanto is so simple that has enabled it to be so expressive. People from a diverse
                set of national language backgrounds speak Esperanto, so it’s important Esperanto can provide the
                flexibility in style and expression required for that.
            </p>

            <p>
                The late Claude Piron, a well known Esperanto speaker and author, talks about this in his book La Bona
                Lingvo (The Good Language):
            </p>

            <p class="esperanto-text">
                Kial esperanto plu ekzistas, kvankam ĝi historie havis pli da ŝancoj morti ol vivi? Ĉar konstante
                venis kaj plu venas al ĝi homoj, kiuj ĝin tiom admiras kaj amas, ke ili dediĉas al ĝia disflorado
                gigantan energion. Indas demandi sin, kio, en ĝi, tiagrade logas.
            </p>

            <p class="english-text">
                Why does Esperanto continue to exist even though historically it has had more opportunities to die than
                to live? Because people continue to come who admire and love it so much that they dedicate huge energy
                to sharing it. It's worth asking yourself what about it attracts people to that degree?
            </p>

            <p class="esperanto-text">
                Mi estas konvinkita, ke la ĉefa faktoro estas la natura fekundeco de la sistemo. Simplegaj rimedoj
                produktas nekredeble altan esprimpovon. La lingvo rapide sentiĝas riĉa; fakte, jam post nur kelkaj
                lecionoj, la lernantoj spertas ion neatenditan, kaj entuziasmigan: ili kapablas kompreni kaj formi
                belajn, amuzajn aŭ trafajn esprimojn, kiujn ili ne povas facile vortigi en sia propra lingvo.
            </p>

            <p class="english-text">
                I'm convinced that the main factor is the natural fertility of the system. Very simple resources produce
                an incredibly high ability of expression. The language quickly feels rich; in fact after only a few
                lessons, learners experience something unexpected and encouraging: they can understand and create
                beautiful, fun or striking expressions, that they can't easily in their own language.
            </p>

            <p class="esperanto-text">
                Krome, ili sentas sin respektataj. Aliaj fremdlingvoj abundas je arbitraj reguloj, kiuj estas kvazaŭ la
                kapricaj decidoj de diktatoro elpensinta pli malpli sadisman manieron omaĝi al lia potenco. Nenio
                simila trafas ilin en esperanto.
            </p>

            <p class="english-text">
                In addition, they feel respected. Other foreign languages have an abundance of arbitrary rules, which
                are like whimsical choices of a dictator, who more or less thought up a sadistic method to pay homage to
                his power. Nothing similar happens in Esperanto.
            </p>

            <p>
                This mirrors my experience coming to realise that Esperanto is surprisingly expressive after a
                relatively short period of use. When there isn’t a shared language available, Esperanto serves its
                intended purpose as an auxillary language very well.
            </p>

            <p>
                I love that I never feel like I’m speaking someone else’s language, nor that I’m speaking my own. Most
                importantly: everyone in the conversation is equally advantaged/disadvantaged in expressing themselves.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have hung out with people from all over the world without a clue which languages they speak, never
                once feeling like I wasn’t equally equipped to express myself and be part of the conversation.
            </p>

            <p>
                This sense of equality when using Esperanto has become a key reason the language is important to me, and
                just one of several attributes that make using Esperanto a unique and rewarding experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thanks Esperanto!
