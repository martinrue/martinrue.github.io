            <h3>Give Yourself More Playtime</h3>

            <p>
                I remember my first computer fondly. As a kid I was more than addicted to the Commodore 64 – perfectly
                happy to sit and endure at least 5 minutes of the most colourful, potentially epileptic
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmPpl6UMuH0">attack</a> you can imagine, simply to have a few
                games of Boulder Dash. It was worth every photon, without a doubt.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today its mechanical keyboard, beige plastic casing, and whopping 64 KB of memory condemns it almost
                exclusively to a quiet life of nostalgia… and some weird Internet forums. But back then it was the most
                fascinating thing 11-year-old me had ever seen.
            </p>

            <p>
                Between games of Boulder Dash, sheer curiosity would keep bringing me back to this bright blue screen
                with hideous white text, wondering what else it could do. Gradually I discovered new commands that made
                it do other things, besides just <code>LOAD</code> – although I still typed that often enough to cause
                the dog to eat a lot of my homework.
            </p>

            <p>
                In time I realised that the machine could run code called BASIC, and that I could simply type it in and
                then type <code>RUN</code> to make it do things. Being 11 and fearing the inevitably gradual violation
                of personal privacy by government, the first program I wrote was a password program.
            </p>

            <p>
                It wasn't very clever. Not even a bit, in fact:
            </p>

            <p>
            <div class="code-block">
                10 PRINT "ENTER PASSWORD"<br>
                20 INPUT L$<br>
                30 IF L$ = "SECRET" THEN GOTO 50<br>
                40 GOTO 10<br>
                50 PRINT "OK"
            </div>
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, that was until I realised something insanely awesome. You probably don't think it's insanely
                awesome, but I definitely did when I was 11.
            </p>

            <p>
                Armed with the knowledge that typing <code>LOAD</code> triggered loading the first program from the
                datasette, I figured that if <code>LOAD</code> became my new line <code>50</code>, this program could
                protect my computer from the government.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's 11-year-old genius in front of your very eyes. The plan was simple: I type this program and follow
                it with a swift <code>RUN</code> command. My code starts running and loops until someone types the
                correct password. When they do, rather than the imaginatively corrupt <code>PRINT "OK"</code>, it runs
                <code>LOAD</code> and begins loading whichever game is in the datasette.
            </p>

            <p>
                Man, I was impressed with myself.
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, until I realised you could just turn the computer off and back on again, type <code>LOAD</code>,
                and completely subvert my entire plan.
            </p>

            <p>
                Obviously, the government would figure that out, so I needed something better.
            </p>

            <p>
                After some careful thought, it became clear to me that the program needed to be on the actual tape, not
                sitting around in memory waiting to suicide as soon as the power went out.
            </p>

            <p>
                Luckily I discovered the sibling of <code>LOAD</code>, <code>SAVE</code>, which allowed me to do just
                that. So, I typed my password program once again, inserted a blank cassette and ran <code>SAVE</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
            <div class="code-block">
                SAVING<br>
                READY.
            </div>
            </p>

            <p>
                Sweet Jesus, it worked.
            </p>

            <p>
                I released the <code>RECORD</code> and <code>PLAY</code> keys on the datasette, pressed
                <code>REWIND</code> and rebooted. Yes, if you wanted to run your program again you'd have to rewind it…
                and that wasn't the only awesome thing about the 90s.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the computer came back to life, I was sat there with my <code>LOAD</code> command at the ready.
                Without even so much as a colour leaping out of the screen and smashing me in the face, my password
                program was running!
            </p>

            <p>
                Still, it would be a pretty big ask to get the government to take out the game they wanted to load, put
                my password program cassette in, and run that first. I mean, I could write some instructions, but I just
                don't think it's very likely they would follow them.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, onto my next wave of genius. I noticed something interesting: this Joseph and the Amazing
                Technicolor Dreamcoat light show that happens when a game is loading doesn't begin immediately after
                running <code>LOAD</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In other words, the tape is spinning but nothing is happening for about 5 seconds. Conveniently, my
                awesome password program took about 1 second to write to a blank tape. If my maths was correct, I had
                plenty of space at the beginning of Boulder Dash to stash my own program.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now I was really getting somewhere! MI5 were probably shitting their pants, I figured.
            </p>

            <p>
                At my earliest inconvenience I invited a friend over to see my achievement. He had a Commodore 64 too,
                so I knew he'd appreciate what I'd done here.
            </p>

            <p>
                He loads my tape. We wait. And BOOM!
            </p>

            <p>
            <div class="code-block">
                ENTER PASSWORD
            </div>
            </p>

            <p>
                I knew he was impressed.
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, I think he was. There wasn't much time between the password prompt appearing and him pressing the
                <code>RUN/STOP</code> key, typing <code>LIST</code>, and reading the god damned password right out of
                the code.
            </p>

            <p>
                Obviously, the government would figure that out too, so I needed something better.
            </p>

            <p>
                My new target swiftly became that damn <code>RUN/STOP</code> key. It took me a few days until I got the
                chance to dial up to the Internet (yes, that was a thing too) and search for a way to stop my friends,
                and the government, breaking my code and listing it to read the password.
            </p>

            <p>
                Eventually I learned that <code>POKE</code> allows you to change values at specific memory addresses,
                and with that it's possible to overwrite vectors to prevent routines such as <code>LIST</code> and
                <code>STOP</code> from working.
            </p>

            <p>
                With my newfound <code>POKE</code> knowledge, my password program was now solid. It was time to write
                this baby to the game tape, making absolutely sure nobody in my family could get better than me at
                Boulder Dash.
            </p>

            <p>
                I was so impressed with my new skill that I didn't just stop at Boulder Dash. In fact, I password
                protected every single one of my favourite game tapes using the same program, quickly rising to fame as
                the family gatekeeper of any game worth playing.
            </p>

            <p>
                It was coming up to summer, and another thing we did as 11-year-old kids in the 90s was go outside in
                summer. Weird, I know.
            </p>

            <p>
                4 or 5 weeks of being a healthy 90s outdoor summer kid and I found myself ready for a nice game of
                Boulder Dash.
            </p>

            <p>
                Wouldn't it have been amusing had I completely forgot whatever eventual password I securely wrote to the
                start of every single one of my favourite games?
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, it wasn't amusing. Not one bit.
            </p>

            <p>
                After brute-forcing approximately every password I had ever used, in every possible combination, and
                breaking down a few times, I was at a loss.
            </p>

            <p>
                It occurred to me that I could attempt to overwrite the current password program with a new one, but I
                was worried that if the program was shorter for some reason, it'd leave the overlap of code from the
                previous program and trash the only copy of the game I owned.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ruling out overwriting the old program, I needed another solution. Then it hit me. It's a tape!
            </p>

            <p>
                You know what they say?
            </p>

            <p>
            <blockquote>
                Never trust a programmer that carries a screwdriver.
            </blockquote>
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm not sure if screwdriver and scissors are interchangeable in this context, but I definitely wasn't to
                be trusted in any case, so it doesn't really matter.
            </p>

            <p>
                The key here was that the datasette would stop moving the tape once the password program had been
                loaded.
            </p>

            <p>
                That gave me a good idea which area of the tape contained the not-so-awesome-afterall program, that I
                was now planning on cutting. Literally, cutting out.
            </p>

            <p>
                A bit of precision and a couple of attempts later, I had successfully hacked my first ever program,
                using a pair of scissors. With great pride, Boulder Dash rose again, and I still sucked at it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking back, I wish I had used my teeth instead of scissors – being able to tell people I cut some code
                from a program by biting it out would have been nice.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've told this story a few times before. It's pretty fun to tell and I like reminding myself of all the
                silly things I used to do.
            </p>

            <p>
                But the moral of the story is that, while on some level all this is kind of silly, on another it's
                important too.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's play. It's something we tend to do more often as kids and lose as we become older. Being older, we
                feel the need to be doing something justifiably productive with our time, as though the pursuit of
                actual or seemingly meaningless things is wasted time.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes it's good to not concern ourselves with whether it's productive or not and just enjoy the
                experience. Being in this frame of mind frees you from any prescribed approach or goal, and leaves you
                open to discovering things you never would have any other way.
            </p>

            <p>
                So if you take anything away from this story, take this:
            </p>

            <p>
                Give yourself more playtime and do silly things. It doesn't always have to be useful. It doesn't always
                have to be justified.
            </p>

            <p>
                Play around more. Discover things.
